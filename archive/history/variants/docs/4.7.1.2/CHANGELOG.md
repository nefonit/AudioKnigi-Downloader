# Changelog

## 4.7.1.2

- Range segments now continue automatically when a CDN/proxy returns a capped partial 206 response (for example 3 MiB).
- Interrupted Range responses preserve already-written bytes and retry from the first missing byte.
- Added regression coverage for server-capped Range responses.

## 4.7.1.1

- Fixed delayed UI error callbacks capturing Python exception variables after the `except` block had exited.
- Fixed all five affected callbacks in analysis, download, recheck and Audiobookshelf paths.
- Added an architecture regression guard that rejects unsafe exception-variable capture inside deferred lambda bodies.
